> Hosted by [Centre for the Business and Economics of Health, Faculty of Business, Economics, and Law, The University of Queensland](https://cbeh.centre.uq.edu.au), {{ site.pub_year }}.

In this session, I will briefly cover the contents described in NICE's DSU Technical Support Document 14.

It will be a fun session! I mean really fun; let's find out the survival rate at the end of the session. It's really fun... sigh...
